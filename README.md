- 👋 Hi, I’m a QinShower,I generally develop web applications through java.
- 🤪`QinShower` is a word that I created myself, I think it has three Chinese meanings:
  - 禽兽(`birds and animals` or `beast`)😁
  - 秦瘦(`thin`)😢
  - 秦受(`masochism`, Just a joke)😳
- 👀 I’m interested in open source.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker
